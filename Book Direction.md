Section A. Sexuality -  Of course we'd start with the fun stuff,  "with sex" - most fun - most potentially damaging

Women should be upset because of biology!  i.e. Smaller bodies on average  // picture of huge woman and small man with caption "Generalities are not always true!" 

Women should be upset because of biology!  Like getting pregnant.  "It's not fair    Men don't get pregnant" picture of bizarre pregnant man -  but women have Longer lives So humorize the facts a bit

Rape - total humiliation loss of choice loss of control over your body and then paradoxically enjoying it and feeling guilty. Date rape as a paradox. Not condoned outside of marriage but fun and guilt provoking!

Rape and pregnancy - creates unsolvable dilemmas? Describe

The dream is sex without consequences.  The reality is STDs,  potential pregnancy and broken relationships with heartbreak. Ideas from I Kissed Dating Goodby

So you "had sex" and now you are pregnant. Notice we did not say you were in a relationship! Maybe you are or maybe you aren't. But behavior is or is not. You "had sex". Leads to the next section on Abortion.

Section B Abortion

Stories of the dilemma that is.

Healing Process - Find resources

Creating options in a difficult situation. Lost options? like the option to not be pregnant is gone.  or have no options. System principal is that Person with the most options has the most power. How to create options in a difficult situation.  Sometimes more options is more power is not always true because of consequences / boundaries / spiritual truth

Who is responsible for your life? People are responsible for their behavior. 


Section C. Family Structures and cultural roles
Women are victimized by role. postured for victimization

Women are victimized by role. postured for victimization  In the Family
 
Women are victimized by role. postured for victimization  In their marriage status

Family structures destroyed

Can you think of any worse situation than that a child lose his or her protector?
Brian story.

Blended families have built in structural weaknesses.

I partnered with a jerk - got rid of him and now I discover all men are jerks!!! Attitude is everything. We attract what we are. 

Now I am alone with kids and career. How does this work? 


Women are the wealthier gender statistically. The reason is they end up historically with the money because they stayed married to a man that creates a lot of wealth and then he dies..

Women are trained to be victims by feminist empowerment ideas. The reason is the feminist put the individual ahead of the unity of the Family system so the people lose their family system. Resulting in disempowerment.
Women victims by empowerment against men.
Crisis center systematic destruction of the family

Victims by attitude training. Women are told they are victims so they take on that role. They are helpless so they are a victim. They are not helpless so they are a victim. Super woman.

Victims by past experience that is unresolved.
Stories - Bringing roses to Colleen.

Define taking offense as personal responsibility. Al anon and other twelve step programs teach that offense is something you take.Being offended is something you chose.  It can not be forced on you. The immature idea is that if I am offended I am a victim. That is a position a person takes not is made to have. If something offends you once or twice and you chose out of it you are not a victim. If you stay in the offending situation you are a volunteer, not a victim.

Don't think women are that stupid! (phrase for use somewhere)

Feminism ruins both sides of the equation because nobody is empowered when a family system is destroyed or someone puts their own self ahead of the unity of a family system.

Religion as a way to control women. Spiritual Abuse book summarized.

because of the breakdown in family structures goes to Domestic Violence

Section D Domestic Violence
Domestic abuse - males are victims women are victims area of greatest loss of rights in our society. Family systems are destroyed.

Women victims by exposure - both physical and mental. Physical exposure as in bikinis!  Mental exposure as if they are to be their own protectors. Women buying more guns to protect themselves

Women victims by laws and victim centers Domestic abuse Crisis Centers as a place to victimize women. Typically they are told to get rid of the abuser which destroys their living system and then they team up with the same or other abuser because nobody has learned to not live an abusive lifestyle. Four children by four women

Families come in systems.  Destroy the system destroy the power.  It takes a team to achieve your dream.

Women carrying the household roles and a career.

I can do it all family and career Superwoman!

Section E Sexual Assault and Homosexuality As a result of victimization
Moving into the forbidden frontier because of previous victimization


Perversion of sexuality like homosexuality - A body defying behavior Four Biblical references included.  1960 all states illegal Sodomy laws

Lesbianism as a result for older women? Nominally homosexual to avoid sexuality and relationship dilemmas with men. See Section E Sexual Assault and Homosexuality As a result of victimization

Some say Gay is not GAY. A very tortured and conflicted lifestyle that is self defeating. No children no future. Multiply and prosper out of Bible. Gay used to mean happy. Now it means conflicted and confused. A political agenda with sound bites that seem okay. Read Revelation on how the wicked rail against God even after judgements similar to the judgments against Egypt before the Pharaoh let God's people go. Story of Christian conference on homosexuality.

Sane sex not same sex We can try to justify body violations against nature but the truth is it is still a violation of self. Promoters of accepting homosexuality have an acceptance motive but it still is not self acceptance of body. High profile homosexual men I'd challenge to place their body violating activity out in the open. Probably is a posture to not be sexual in some cases. Would like a study on that.

The wave to legitimize homosexuality. Accept me as I am is Self on the throne of life. That does not achieve quality lifestyles like a Higher Power and the spiritual principles brought by a Higher Power to guide life. Trying to make the illegitimate legitimate is still illegitimate because that is an illegitimate society.  Saying cancer is healthy does not make it healthy. That is not an unenlightened viewpoint of a bigot as promoters of homosexuality try to make others look like. It is a foundational fact of people expressing truth about their and other people's bodies. The fact that some political entities have made conversion therapy illegal makes homosexuality look like an accepted practice. That may be what choice a person makes but does not change the fact there are people with debilitating homosexual tendencies either in thinking or in behavior out of their thinking that want to be free of homosexuality as a bondage in their lives. To make that therapy illegal is stupid. People can't get the changes they want if that therapy is illegal. 

Conversion therapy, also called reparative therapy, is any treatment aimed at converting lesbians and gay men to heterosexuality. Such treatments have been criticized as a form of pseudoscience and are controversial. (political controversy)

Why we see that as victimization. Body defying acts. We see them as mental traits but self violation. 

Resulted from previous bodily affronts.  John Hagee video showing a about 17 year old male that was a practicing homosexual after he was sexually assaulted as a toddler.

Victimizing perpetrators forever.  Tough to change sexual predators but sometimes doable. How do we assess so it is not a life long label if the reality changes.

Story of George native imprisoned and sodomized repeatedly. In your face smoker.


Section F. Superwoman as the pinnacle of victimization
How does a woman juggle a career and family and self? Most people say juggling family and career but the most important to juggle is "self".

Perfectionism as a lie. Out of Al anon books and body image training and rhetoric. 

Feminism as empowerment has backfired in some ways. The reason is when you put an individual ahead of a system the system collapses and disempowers all the individuals in the system. It champions freedom to chose but has no limits and little future flexibility.  Story of mother with four children by four fathers in about five years. 

Teaching men to be heads of households instead of irresponsible boys created by feminism. The other side of women are on their own means men have dropped their responsibility.
How to get protection - gun owners grow in women because they are not protected.

History of womanhood from past writing in abortion manual

Submission to a loving higher power as evidenced in a loving support group.
mutual submission in a loving relationship / marriage  Ephesians 5

living together tends to not work and results in breaking up.  These relationships collapse more than people that wait for marriage. Do studies research

Commentary of things not organized
I kissed dating  goodbye - book title of a book to research

The current "sexual revolution" is really same old same old. People trying to legitimize their behavior. The Bible reveals human nature from Sodom and Gomorrah to Adultery to prostitutes to modern day concubines. Young people today have been taught we are progressing sexually by same sex marriage etc. The Bible shows that is the same old same old human perverted human nature.  Sane sex not same sex


Section G. What is the answer?  Personal actions that a person can take

Renovate personal choice

Practice Good boundaries
How to prevent potential victimizations by boundaries that protect. God's simple plan of waiting for sex until and only in marriage protects the children and adults. Children have parents in the home and parents do not get STDs or guilt if they sexualize only in their marriage.

Get Help
where to go for help

Self Help - Taking responsibility for your life. Who is responsible for my life?

Self will versus gods will.

Help from others

Helping professions

Creating a support system with others of similar interests
Al anon etc.
twelve step groups
Family support Choose people that support you not those that will destroy you.

Church support - Book on Spiritual Abuse

Agency help and "helping professions"
As family come in systems so do agencies and helping professionals come in system. Story of me as an in home therapist. Half the time families needed to change. Half the time the agencies like, school, social services, and probation / court systems needed to change. Of course they do not change so the strategy had to be to reframe the attack person's understanding of the family.

Dirty little secret of counselors. Rogerian Roulette. Counselor lies by omission. Doesn't tell you what he thinks.  Carl Rogers as a giant in counseling theory who does not set boundaries!!! But uses the client's flawed framework to build on. It is very useful and growth provoking to a point. Humanist so its self on the throne. Sometimes that is useful to get a person closer to personal responsibility but when they become the god of Self under humanism they lose boundaries that protect. See twelve steps to understand. 

Following spiritual principles like Light always overcomes darkness   Darkness cannot exist in the light

Personal attitudes - Surrender to win

Section H What is the Answer?  Community actions

To protect babies incentivized promotions for empowering babies

To protect women Incentivized promotions  to get personal stories with a purpose and purpose

Teaching Healthy boundaries

Community action supporting adults managing their sexuality

Sharing Success stories in a recovery group
 
Backside stories

Sayings
Life is too important to be taken seriously

When I go to the health club to walk I like to park as close as possible to the building so I don't have to walk so far!!!!

"And they lived happily ever after"  Story on how I approached driving after the family chaos
I worked with over three hundred families over a fifteen year period. Every on of the families were going to lose one or more children out of the home if something did not change for them in how the family was functioning. To try to give you an idea of how chaotic things could be in a family I had a family living in the country with eight children and six dogs. It was very difficult to find a place to walk without stepping into something! Many other families lived in trailer parks with little or no boundaries on what happened. Neighbor children would pass through the trailer with no rhyme or reason. Chaos prevailed!!  Had one client that the family was a hoarding family. They lived in a trailer. When you came into the trailer it was a storage shed of things they hoarded!  You had a path to the kitchen with things almost overwhelming your ability to walk. Things were piled as high as you could get them off the sides of the path. The only other path was back to the bathroom and bedrooms with similar piles of "stuff" off the sides of the path. After going out to families like this if you were a successful therapist you "joined" with the family. Which means you became like them! Living a life of chaos and getting paid for it!!  The truth was you'd get confused by the chaos and start functioning like the family you were in. You got in the boat with them!!!  Well I did not want the chaos and confusion in my life so I created a ceremony to deal with this craziness I had to be in. The ceremony was done in my car after every session. The car was my sanctuary!!  So when I climbed into the car before I would start driving I would say  OUT LOUD, " And they lived happily ever after!!!". Then I could drive safely and with a bit of sanity!

Life is short. Do stuff that matters
